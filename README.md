# Low_Resource_KBP
knowledge graph population in low resource conditions


The file "Few-Shot_ED.json.zip" is the dataset for the paper accepted by WSDM 2020 ["Meta-Learning with Dynamic-Memory-Based Prototypical Network for Few-Shot Event Detection"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11621)

* We first scale up the number of event types in existing datasets, including the [ACE-2005 corpus](http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/ace/), and [TAC-KBP-2017 Event Track Data](https://tac.nist.gov/2017/KBP/Event/index.html).

* We then import and extend some new event types based on an [automatically-labeled event data](https://github.com/acl2017submission/event-data), from Freebase and Wikipedia, constrained to specific domains such as music, film, sports, education, etc.
